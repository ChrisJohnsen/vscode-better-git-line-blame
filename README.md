# VS Code Git Line Blame

A simple VS Code extension that decorates the current line with git blame information.

I created this extension because I found [GitLens] to be too bloated. Line blaming is the only feature that I actually need.

## Install

```sh
npm install
npm install -g vsce
vsce package
code --install-extension *.vsix
```

## Features

- Displays line decorations in the same style as GitLens.
- Decorates all lines at once when selecting multiple lines.
- On hover, shows the commit author, date, message, and SHA.
- Includes a "Show diff" link using VS Code's built-in diff viewer.
- Supports multiple git repositories in the same workspace.
- Uses `git blame --incremental` to provide blame quickly and incrementally.
- Loads commit message lazily without blocking blame decoration rendering.
- Caches all information to avoid invoking git more than necessary.
- Handles untracked files, unsaved edits, and git branch changes.
- Provides "Reblame File" and "Clear Cache" commands (rarely needed).

## Alternatives

The alternative I'm competing with is [GitLens]. I find it too bloated, and dislike how it pushes paid features.

Someone else had the exact same idea with [carlthome/vscode-git-line-blame](https://github.com/carlthome/vscode-git-line-blame). However, as of March 2024, that extension is much simpler: it spawns a git process every time the cursor moves.
