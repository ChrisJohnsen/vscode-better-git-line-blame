# VS Code Git Line Blame

A simple VS Code extension that annotates the current line with git blame information.

I created this extension because I found [GitLens] to be too bloated. Line annotations are the only feature that I actually need.

## Install

```sh
npm install -g vsce
vsce package
code --install-extension *.vsix
```
